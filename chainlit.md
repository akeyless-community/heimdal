# Hello, I'm Heimdal ðŸ‘‹

## A prototype "Agentic" Helm Chart Installer

I can help you install and configure the Akeyless Gateway into the very namespace I am currently deployed into, provided I have the necessary permissions.

I am able to run tools like scanning the environment to find out the kubernetes namespace and service account of this deployment and verify I have the necessary permissions to install the Akeyless Gateway.

I can figure out the specific cloud service provider where this bot is installed and create the appropriate Akeyless authentication method.

I can deploy the helm chart using the authentication method Access ID. Once the helm chart is deployed, I can return all the details about everything we've created.

Thank you for using The Akeyless Vaultless Platform!

Click the settings button below, right next to the `Type your message here...` input to set your Akeyless token and get started.
